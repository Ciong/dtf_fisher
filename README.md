dtf_fisher
==========

Improved Dense Trajectory features encoded by Fisher Vectors

This is the implementations of DTF+Fisher vector on UCF101. Two
implementations of Fisher vector are used in this program: INRIA
Yael(https://gforge.inria.fr/frs/download.php/33202/yael_v371.tar.gz) and VGG
VLFfeat(http://www.vlfeat.org/, used by default). 

If you want to run the CGG implementation(the default one), an matlab
toolkit(enceval-toolkit-1.1.tar.gz)
is also needed and you download it from
http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/software/enceval_toolkit/.

LIBSVM is also needed for classification. 

To run the program, please execute "master" in Matlab.
