dtf_fisher
==========

Improved Dense Trajectory features encoded by Fisher Vectors

This is the implementations of DTF+Fisher vector on UCF101 dataset.
VGG fisher vector implementation(http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/software/enceval_toolkit/.) and VLFfeat(http://www.vlfeat.org/) package are used. 

LIBSVM is also needed for one-vs-rest classification. 

To run the program, please execute "master" in Matlab.
