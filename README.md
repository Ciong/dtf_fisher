==========

Improved Dense Trajectory features encoded by Fisher Vectors

This is the implementations of DTF+Fisher vector on UCF101 dataset.
VGG fisher vector implementation(http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/software/enceval_toolkit/.) and VLFfeat(http://www.vlfeat.org/) package are used. LIBSVM is also needed for one-vs-rest classification. 

For theoretical introduction about this project, please refer to [Action Recognition with Fisher Vectors](http://www.bo-yang.net/2014/04/30/fisher-vector-in-action-recognition) and [DTF Notes](http://www.bo-yang.net/2014/01/10/dense-trajectory-notes) on [my blog](bo-yang.github.io).

To run the program, please execute "master" in Matlab.
